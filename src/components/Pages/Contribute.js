      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>
        The PHLASK App is being developed by a collectively organized group of
        volunteers known as the PHLASK Cooperative. We operate with the
        principles of non-hierarchical, collective self-management in service of
        fulfilling the project’s mission. The PHLASK Cooperative is composed of
        individuals of varying socioeconomic, educational and technical
        backgrounds, and welcomes all individuals to contribute to the project’s
        mission. Our core operating philosophy, and established norms for
        cooperation, are rooted in transparency, sharing and mentorship. We
        welcome all newcomers to help us uphold these principles and continue
        nurturing the equitable growth and development of all project
        contributors as we work together to create a tool to benefit the public.
